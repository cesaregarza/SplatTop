Alternatively, if you have your NPLN ID you can access your page directly via <span class='text-purplelight'>splat.top/player/npln_id_goes_here</span>. Note: If you were briefly in the Top 500 and missed by our data collection, you won't find your ranking.</p>"

While the methodology tends to be more accurate than not, there are edge cases where the weapon data may be incorrect. This is not something we can fix without massive effort, as it would require at least doubling the scraping cadence to minimize errors. If you believe the data is incorrect, feel free to contact us with the details. We can't guarantee a fix, but the knowledge helps us improve the system for everyone.</p>"

There are times when the data is simply not available. We try our best to make sure the data pipeline is uninterrupted, but sometimes Nintendo's decisions are out of our control.
