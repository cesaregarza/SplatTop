      "key": "can_i_see_my_own_ranking",
      "question": "Can I see my own ranking?",
      "answer": "<p class='text-white'>Yes, you can view your ranking if you've been in the Top 500. Search using any in-game name you had when you reached the Top 500. Alternatively, if you have your NPLN ID you can access your page directly via <span class='text-purplelight'>splat.top/player/npln_id_goes_here</span>. Note: If you were briefly in the Top 500 and missed by our data collection, you won't find your ranking.</p>"

      "key": "my_weapon_data_is_incorrect",
      "question": "My weapon data is incorrect. Can you fix it?",
      "answer": "<p class='text-white'><span class='text-purplelight'>Weapon data</span> is calculated based on the snapshot appearances in the Top 500 as maintained by SplatNet3. While the methodology tends to be more accurate than not, there are edge cases where the weapon data may be incorrect. This is not something we can fix without massive effort, as it would require at least doubling the scraping cadence to minimise errors. If you believe the data is incorrect, feel free to contact us with the details. We can't guarantee a fix, but the knowledge helps us improve the system for everyone.</p>"

      "question": "The line cuts off randomly, what happened?",
      "answer": "<p class='text-white'>It's probably a data outage caused by Nintendo. The scraper is designed to be highly robust, but it can't handle every situation. There are times when the data is simply not available. We try our best to make sure the data pipeline is uninterrupted, but sometimes Nintendo's decisions are out of our control. We apologise for the inconvenience.</p>"
