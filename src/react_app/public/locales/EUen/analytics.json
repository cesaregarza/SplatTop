A positive skill offset indicates that the weapon and/or the players using it are performing better than expected. A negative skill offset indicates the opposite. A weapon with a high pick rate and low skill offset indicates that the weapon is carrying players to the Top 500. A weapon with a low pick rate and high skill offset indicates that the weapon is being used by a few highly skilled players. Data here will change frequently as the Top 500 weapon picks will update even if the player isn't playing X Battles. Use this information with caution.",

A Gini Coefficient of 0 represents perfect equality, meaning all weapons are equally successful, indicating a perfectly balanced meta. Conversely, a Gini Coefficient of 1 represents perfect inequality, where one weapon dominates entirely, indicating a highly imbalanced meta.",
